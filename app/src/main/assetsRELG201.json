People on the wait list will be added to the main course in order of registration as spaces open up.\nThis course focuses on the related corpora of biblical and ancient Near Eastern mythologies, particularly literature from ancient Iraq, Syria, and Israel. We will explore how these texts both reveal and conceal aspects of their cultures and consider the ways in which media (i.e., the material that scribes used) and context (e.g., literary, religious, archaeological, etc.) contribute to our understanding of them. While our main focus will be on what these texts meant to their ancient audiences, we will also reflect on their continued influence in the modern world.\n","courseName":"Near Eastern and Biblical Mythology","courseNumber":"201","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"An introduction to the world of Near Eastern mythology, from the Gilgamesh Epic to the Book of Genesis and beyond.","sections":[{"section":"001"},{"section":"002"}]}
