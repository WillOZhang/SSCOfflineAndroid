{"reqs":"Philosophers have had a problematic relationship with the sexual aspects of humanity, both the division of humanity along the lines of a male/female dichotomy, as well as the categories and practices involved in sexual activity. Issues of sex and gender are of significant ethical importance because of the significant disparities visible across history in the social positions of men and women, and because of the centrality of sexual and family norms in the reproduction of moral norms more generally. This course will provide a window on these subjects by looking at how some recent philosophers (as well as a few classic ones) have thought about sex and gender, with a special focus on contemporary feminism and the problem of sexual harassment.\n","courseName":"Sex, Gender and Philosophy","courseNumber":"334","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Relationship between sex, gender, and philosophy.
