{"reqs":"Pre-reqs: (9 credits of PHIL at the 200-level or above; PHIL 230 is recommended.)\nCourse Description and Aims:\nThis course will focus on an area of ethical theory known as metaethics. In metaethics we do not consider directly what it takes to live a good life, to be a good person, to do the right thing, etc. Those are questions for normative ethics (see 230A). Instead, we step back and ask more general questions about morality and moral discourse. For example, *what does it mean* to say that some act is the right thing to do, or some individual is a good person? Do these sentences describe some moral properties out there in the world - the properties of being right and being good? Or do they merely express some positive attitudes toward actions and people? If some actions really are right, *what kind of property would this be*? Would it be identical to the natural property of producing the most hand~\nappiness? Being approved of by an impartial observer? Or would it be a non-natural property? Are there such properties, and if so, *how do we know* which actions have them? This course will cover systematic answers to questions like these, including naturalism, non-naturalism, constructivism, error theory, and non-cognitivism.\n","courseName":"Topics in Ethical Theory","courseNumber":"432","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Classic or contemporary works in ethical theory.","sections":[{"section":"001"}]}
