{"reqs":"Term 1 course - 3 credits. Interested students will need to submit to Dr. Dodson (alan.dodson(at)ubc.ca; Rm. 423 MUSC building), a written proposal -- outlining what work will be done, how it will be evaluated, and signed by the supervising FT faculty member. MUSC 402 should be in a music-related subject that a full-time Music faculty member can supervise. 402s have to be approved by the Undergraduate Committee Chair (Dr. Alan Dodson - alan.dodson(at)ubc.ca or 604-822-5287). Develop a written proposal as follows: Brainstorm topics; talk to some professors (not part-time faculty), see who's interested and available to supervise you.\nWrite a proposal that:\n* describes the topic\n* describes the type and quantity of work you will do (typically each week you'll do 4-5 hours of independent research, then meet for an hour with the supervisor; and at the end you'll produce a substantial paper. Think about the course as if it is an upper-level history course, with classtime and research papers.)\n* specifies the number of credits (3 for one term, 6 for the full year, which would obviously require twice the work)\n* describes how your work will be evaluated (graded)\n* names the supervisor, and explains what kind of supervision s/he will provide\nGet the supervisor to sign the proposal so that I know s/he is willing to work with you, and that s/he agrees to evaluate you as the proposal states.\n","courseName":"Special Projects - SPECIAL PROJECTS","courseNumber":"402A","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"For fourth-year students who receive permission of the Director of the School of Music to do advanced studies in their major field.","sections":[]}
