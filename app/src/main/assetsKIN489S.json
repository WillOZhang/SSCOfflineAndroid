{"reqs":"Pre-reqs: (Fourth-year standing. Consult with Advisor for specific prerequisites.)\nCourse Topic: Gender Matters in Sport, Health, and Physical Activity\nOne of the most fascinating aspects of contemporary society is how gender shapes the way sports are structured, experienced and represented. Gender matters in sport, health and physical activity. Media representations inform gendered views while multinational agencies and philanthropic societies organize their activities around them.\nWe will discuss the significance of gender in reference to the male body and competing masculinities, as well as the historical and contemporary experiences and meanings of womens involvement in sport in a variety of levels and settings.\nPhysical activity, including health related exercise prescription, is also a deeply gendered arena reflecting social, medical, and scientific views about fitness, body size and shape, physical literacy, and attitudes toward sexuality, race, ethnicity, aging and the needs of the disabled.\nThroughout the seminar we will also explore the gendered terrain of work in kinesiology related fields in order to better position students in their future careers.\n","courseName":"Seminar - SEMINAR","courseNumber":"489S","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Current topics and research in specific areas.","sections":[{"section":"002"}]}
