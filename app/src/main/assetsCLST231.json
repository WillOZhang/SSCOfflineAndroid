This rule does not concern the new CLST 331 (first taught in\n2014) 'Greek Art and Architecture', which is a completely different course than the old CLST 331. If you are unsure about registration in any of these courses, please do not hesitate to contact the undergraduate advisor of CNERS, Dr. Lyn Rae (lyn.rae@ubc.ca).\n","courseName":"Ancient Greece","courseNumber":"231","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"A survey of the ancient Greek world from the Minoan and Mycenaean (about 2000-1000 BCE) to the Hellenistic Period (323-30 BCE).","sections":[{"section":"001"}]}
