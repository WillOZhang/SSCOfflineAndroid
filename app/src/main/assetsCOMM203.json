{"reqs":"Pre-reqs: COMM 292 and either (a) all of ECON 101, ECON 102 or (b) ECON 100.\nEquivalents: COMM 392\nThis section will be offered in a flexible learning format. Rather than attending traditional in-class lectures for three hours each week, students in this FLEX section will spend most of their time with online learning materials with only 3 scheduled in-person class meetings during Term 1 (or Term 2). These meetings will be during the regularly scheduled time for the course and attendance on these three days is mandatory. All of the rest of the work is done online, or in groups on your groups own schedule. This provides you with great flexibility in terms of when and where you complete the coursework.\nThis FLEX section and the traditional (non-FLEX) sections of this course cover the same material, use the same text, include the same two group based simulations, and have a common final exam. The workload is equivalent, but how you complete the course is quite different.\nThis section will be offered in a flexible learning format.
