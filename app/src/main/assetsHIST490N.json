{"reqs":"(HIST 490 is intended for History majors, History honours students, and students majoring in the history and philosophy of science, but students from other departments may register if they obtain the instructor's permission.)\nThe Early Modern Mediterranean: This seminar will explore topics and debates in early modern Mediterranean history, 1450-1750. Historically and in current affairs, the Mediterranean is often portrayed as a \"borderland\" or \"frontier\" separating vastly different cultures and peoples: the Christian and Muslim worlds; Europe, Asia and Africa. Historians, however, have shown that the Mediterranean has been a space of constant entanglement and exchange, a liquid continent where societies and cultures met, overlapped and co-exited, sometimes peacefully, sometimes violently, since ancient times.\n","courseName":"Seminar for Majors in History - SEM FOR HIST MAJ","courseNumber":"490N","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Selected problems in the theory and practice of historical work.
