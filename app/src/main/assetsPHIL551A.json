{"reqs":"This course will be held in BUCH D324.\nDo people with radically different background theories perceive the world in different ways? Is the human mind composed of innate special-purpose cognitive system that have been shaped by natural selection? Is language essential to some forms of cognition? What role does emotion play when you are thinking about the right way to act? What features of the mind underlie distinctively human intellectual achievements? Questions like thesequestions about the structure of the mindare of enormous philosophical interest but cant be answered without paying close attention to developments in the cognitive sciences. This seminar will focus on a few topics that illustrate important connections between philosophical theorizing and empirical research. We will start with the issue of what mental moduand~\nles are and whether the mind is massively modular. After that, the exact topics covered will depend upon the interests of the seminar participants.\nPermission is required to take this course for students who are not members of the UBC Philosophy graduate program. Please e-mail professor Margolis for further information.\n","courseName":"Philosophy of Mind - PHIL OF MIND","courseNumber":"551A","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"","sections":[{"section":"001"},{"section":"002"}]}
