{"reqs":"Pre-reqs: (PHIL 240 is recommended.)\nThis course is an introduction to metaphysics. It focuses on the reality part of Knowledge and Reality. What is metaphysics? Perhaps paradoxically, this is a question that metaphysics itself tries to answer. But one first relatively uncontroversial answer is the following: Metaphysics is the study of the most general and fundamental features of reality. So, it is a huge field that covers many subjects. In this class we will discuss some of the central, traditional topics in contemporary analytic metaphysics, like Time, Causation, Necessity, God and Personal Identity among others.\nThis course is an introduction to metaphysics.
