{"reqs":"Technical Workshop Series for Biomedical Engineering\nThis course consists of several workshops modules offered throughout the year, which will be run in a hands-on, tutorial-style manner. The workshops will be focused on providing technical skills required for successful academic or industrial careers for biomedical engineering students.\nThe workshop topics include (but are not limited to):\nLaser scanning and mesh processing, Design and fabrication (3D printing), Applied machine learning, Image analysis and computer vision, Micro-controllers (Arduino or Rasberry pi), Web/mobile application development, Graphics processing (GPU) and parallel processing, Printed circuit board (PCB) design and fabrication, Introduction to object oriented programming, Motion/gait analysis, Scientific publication and documentation with Latex and Academic illustration design.\nThe sessions will begin with a broad overview of the workshop topics and the attendees are expected to design/implement something specified by the workshop instructor using the particular technical skill taught during the workshop. Workshops that require special equipment will be held in an appropriate location so that students and instructors have proper access to the equipment. Students will receive 1 credit once they have successfully accumulated 40 hours of workshops over the span of their program.\nThis course is open to MEng, MASc and PhD students who are registered in the BME program. Other students interested in the course should contact the BME Program Office.\nShould you require more details, please feel free to contact Hooman Esfandiari (hooman.esfandiari@ubc.ca).\n","courseName":"Topics in Biomedical Engineering - TPCS BIOMED ENG","courseNumber":"591M","credits":"Credits: 1","description":"","sections":[{"section":"001"}]}
