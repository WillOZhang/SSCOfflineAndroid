{"reqs":"Pre-reqs: MUSC 300.\nContemporary Art Music: Theory and Analysis. This course explores the diverse concert-music repertoire since 1950, so in a sense it is a continuation and enrichment of Music 300. Although the course focuses primarily on compositional, theoretical, and analytical issues, the position of the works with respect to important social, aesthetic, and philosophical trends will also be considered. A wide range of composers and styles will be considered, beginning with the European modernists of the 1950s, but branching out to include (according to students' interests) postmodern works by eminent American, Canadian, and Asian composers.\nThe course is designed for fourth-year undergraduates and first-year graduate students. The latter will participate at a level appropriate to their degree program and specialty, possibly including performing, lecturing, or original research, as determined in consultation with the instructor.\n","courseName":"Contemporary Art Music: Theory and Analysis","courseNumber":"413","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"A technical approach to the diverse concert-music repertoire since 1950, including orchestral, chamber, solo, and electro-acoustic genres.
