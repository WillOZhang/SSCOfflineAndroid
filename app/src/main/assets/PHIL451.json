{"reqs":"Pre-reqs: PHIL 240. (or COGS 200 if accompanied by 3 credits of PHIL at the 200-level or above.)\nThis course will focus on the nature of consciousness and the self. What is consciousness and how is it related to the brain, the rest of the body, and the physical world? Can consciousness be explained in physical terms? Can there be a scientific understanding of consciousness or will consciousness remain forever mysterious? Is there a self or is the self an illusion? Guided by these questions, we will examine consciousness and the sense of self across a wide variety of states, including awake perception, dreaming, lucid dreaming, deep sleep, out-of-body experiences, dying and near-death experiences, as well as meditative states. We will draw from a wide variety of sources, including contemporary philosophy of mind, Indian philosophy, and Buddhist philosophy, as well as cognitive sciencand~\ne, especially the neuroscience of consciousness, sleep science, and the neuroscience of meditation.\n","courseName":"Philosophy of Mind","courseNumber":"451","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"The nature of the mental and physical; the relation between minds and bodies; the character of psychological explanation.","sections":[{"section":"001"},{"section":"002"}]}
