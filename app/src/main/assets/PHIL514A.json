{"reqs":"Instructor: Peter Schouls. This course will be held in BUCH D324.\nThe guiding thread for this course will be Descartes quest for certainty in philosophy and the sciences. Four prominent aspects of this quest may be formulated as follows. (i) There is an assumed certainty in the tradition--a tradition in which the presence of God looms large. But in the Cartesian project, the prominence of God is chiefly a device to reveal the absolute trustworthiness of human reason. (ii) We need to distinguish between warranted and unwarranted certainty, to understand how unwarranted certainty is obtained, and to acquire the power to erase it and forestall subsequent infestation with it. Such distinguishing and understanding requires the working in tandem of human freedom and reason. (iii) The proper use of freedom and reason together will lead to an articulation of and~\nthe proper methodical procedures, and of the necessary criteria, which can lead us to warranted certainty in philosophy and in the sciences. (iv) This method dictates thorough individual epistemic autonomy.\n","courseName":"Early Modern Philosophy - ERLY MODERN PHIL","courseNumber":"514A","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"","sections":[{"section":"001"}]}
