{"reqs":"Course will be held in Audain Art Centre room 4000, Graduate lounge. ||\nMFA seminar for students in the second year of the MFA program.\nThe Practice of Reading and Writing: Today, artists who pursue an MFA (and ever more frequently now a PhD) with the aim of dedicating themselves to developing a challenging art practice, as well as of preparing themselves to enter fully into the contemporary art world, rarely just make artworks anymore. They read a fair bit (usually for research purposes or inspiration). Many teach, curate, write, and/or do lectures and talks. This could be understood as playing into bureaucratic norms, or enriching/complicating the current discourse around art. Reading, writing, and performing can be a deciding factor not only on ones position within the art world, but also on the impact your art practice will have on the public.\nThis seminar will be divided between critiques of students artworks and looking at a few prominent artists whose practices combine art making, thinking, reading, writing, and performance, among them: Martha Rosler, Allan Sekula, Tacita Dean, Seth Price, Jeff Wall, Stan Douglas, Isabelle Pauwels, Kelly Wood, Maria Eichhorn, Andrea Fraser, and Liam Gillick.\nCourse will be held in Audain Art Centre room 4000, Graduate lounge. ||\nMFA seminar for students in the second year of the MFA program.\nThe Practice of Reading and Writing: Today, artists who pursue an MFA (and ever more frequently now a PhD) with the aim of dedicating themselves to developing a challenging art practice, as well as of preparing themselves to enter fully into the contemporary art world, rarely just make artworks anymore.
