{"reqs":"Pre-reqs: (6 credits of 200-level VISA.)\nVISA 370A: Animation and Animism\nAnimism is the belief in things and images being alive, having some animating force behind them. Artworks can be amongst them. This course will focus on the making of animated films, but will extend out to the concept of making animate works more generallywhether in the form of painting, drawing, photography, sculpture, performance, or any other medium. The course will therefore combine a variety of approaches to making animated works (including animation proper: using drawing, collage, 3D elements, stop-motion, and digital applications) with reading theoretical/historical texts, watching animated films, and looking at what could be considered to be animated artworks.\n","courseName":"Special Studies I - SPECIAL STUDY I","courseNumber":"370A","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Intermediate tutorial.
