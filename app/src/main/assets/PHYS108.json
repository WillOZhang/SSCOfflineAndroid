{"reqs":"Pre-reqs: Either (a) PHYS 107 or (b) a score of 85% or higher in PHYS 101 or (c) a score of 85% or higher in PHYS 117.\nCo-reqs: One of MATH 101, MATH 103, MATH 105, MATH 121.\nStudents with PHYS 117 wanting to take PHYS 108 please email to Physics Advisor ug-phys2ATphas.ubc.ca for registration help.\nAll students taking PHYS 108 are strongly advised to also register for PHYS 109, the associated 1 credit lab course, or PHYS 119 for those who have taken PHYS 101 or 117 instead of PHYS 107, since a lab component is required for most upper level lab courses in the sciences. Students intending to pursue any of the Physics and Astronomy specializations definitely require the PHYS 109 or PHYS 119 lab.\nPlease contact Prof. Janis McKenna at ug-phys2ATphas.ubc.ca for any questions regarding PHYS 107 or PHYS 108 registration, course or tutorials.\nThe lecturer in this course will utilize the Personal Response System (i-clicker) as a part of the instructional method for the course. Students should purchase a transponder (ie i-clicker) prior to attending the first lecture in the course.\n","courseName":"Enriched Physics II","courseNumber":"108","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Electricity and magnetism, electrical circuits, induction, electromagnetic waves, Maxwell's equations and applications.
