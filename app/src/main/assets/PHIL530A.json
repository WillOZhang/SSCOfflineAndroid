{"reqs":"This course will be held in BUCH D324.\nElizabeth Anscombe's ground-breaking work on action (in particular her book _Intention_) remains some of the most difficult and important work on a subject that is a central concern of ethics, and a problem in many of the central approaches to normative ethical theory. This course will read a bit of the historical context into which Anscombe intervenes (Aristotle, Aquinas, Hume, Ryle), then slowly work through _Intention_. We will then look at the reception of her work by earlier writers (Davidson, Velleman) and then at more recent work to refresh and develop her account (Thompson, Moran, Vogler, Setiya). Some attention will be given to issues of collective action/intentionality, and some to the role thought about action plays in deontology and utilitarianism.\n\n","courseName":"Moral Philosophy - MORAL PHILOSOPHY","courseNumber":"530A","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"","sections":[{"section":"001"}]}
