You will be moved into active registration IF space becomes available. Timetables MAY BE MODIFIED to allow conflict-free registration. Waitlisting does not guarantee placement in this course. If you are waitlisted, it is recommended that you access the SSC periodically to check your status. It is YOUR responsibility to check the SSC for registration changes.\n","courseName":"Chemistry for Engineering","courseNumber":"154","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Chemical bonding, properties of matter.
