{"reqs":"Equivalents: ARTH 431, ARTH 433\nThe Holy City of Jerusalem: Desire and Conflict || Today political control over Jerusalem and its holy sites is one of the most difficult sticking points for any accord that hopes to end the current Arab-Israeli conflict. Jews and Arab Palestinians each claim they have superior rights to the city while many Christians around the world would prefer some international arrangement that would insure respect for Jerusalems Christian holy sites as well. Moreover, historically, Jerusalem has been at the center of the development of concepts and practices of holy war that today are threatening to engulf our world in ever-wider hostilities. The aim of this seminar is to promote a better understanding of this deep-rooted conflict by exploring the sanctity and centrality of Jerusalem to Judaism, Cand~\nhristianity, and Islam from Biblical times through the Middle Ages considering both the actual city and the city as metaphor for salvation. Special attention will be given to the era of the Crusades and the role of art and architecture as well as space, vision, pilgrimage and ritual as they have helped to construct, and often contest, meaning and memory of this site for diverse audiences.\n","courseName":"Seminar in the Art of the Middle Ages","courseNumber":"432","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"","sections":[{"section":"001"}]}
