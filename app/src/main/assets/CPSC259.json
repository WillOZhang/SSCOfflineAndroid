{"reqs":"Pre-reqs: APSC 160.\nThe majority of the seats in this course are reserved for students taking this course through a standard timetable (STT). If all of the non-STT are used please register on the wait list. Once classes start, and we know how many unused STT seats there are, we will move students from the wait list to the course. There is no guarantee that all students on the wait list will be admitted to the course.\nNote: All the seats in L1H are reserved for students who are not taking this course through a STT. All other seats are reserved for students using a STT. Unused lab seats will be made available starting around the start of September once it is known how many students have regsitered using a STT.\nThis section is reserved for students in the mechatronics option.\n","courseName":"Data Structures and Algorithms for Electrical Engineers","courseNumber":"259","credits":"Credits: 4","description":"Advanced procedural programming.
