{"reqs":"Qualitative research is embedded in disciplinary histories and in contexts of power which generate questions about ethics, knowledge-production and responsibility. This seminar offers a critical examination of qualitative methods framed by the anthropological approach of ethnography, including: interviewing, observation, oral and archival history, participatory research, material culture and collaboration. We will work from readings on methodology, from field accounts and case studies that look to the shifting ethnographic enterprise and to writing strategies, representation and issues raised by public scholarship.\n","courseName":"Qualitative Methods in Anthropology","courseNumber":"516","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"A discussion of selected methods used to observe, describe, and interpret cultural phenomena and social organization, including participant observation, interviewing, ethnographic semantics, life histories, componential analysis, and photography.
