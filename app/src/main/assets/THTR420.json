Students will become familiar with the major movements in modern theatre (realism, naturalism, expressionism, absurdism and so forth) and a number of significant authors. In addition to reading plays as representative of particular authors, periods and movements in theatre history, we will also read plays against each other, examining the ways in which similar themes are dealt with in different periods, exploring issues of gender, politics, and other social issues, especially issues of diversity in the theatre. THTR 320 or permission of the instructor is required to register in this course.\n","courseName":"History of Theatre II","courseNumber":"420","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Key movements in world theatre history from the nineteenth century to the present.","sections":[{"section":"001"}]}
