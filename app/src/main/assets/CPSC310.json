{"reqs":"Pre-reqs: CPSC 210.\nRegiser on this wait list only if you can take CPSC 310 in both terms.\nThere are currently 4 sections of CPSC 310 showing. Of those 4\nsections we are only going to offer 3. Sections 101 and 201 are\ndefinitely going ahead but only one of sections 102 or 202 will be\noffered. For planing purposes you can assume that the the time shown\nfor sections 102 and 202 coresponds to the time it will be offered at,\nif it is the one ultimately offered. Unfortunately we don't know\nwhich section it will be offered, butHopefully this will be resolved by the time\n3rd year students have to register. To provide students with the most\nregistration flexibility we are using 3 wait lists. Each wait list has a specifipurpose so once the 310 section you want is full register on the wait list that best meets your needs. If you can only take 310 in term 1 register on wait list WT1. If you can only take 310 in term 2 register on wait list WT2. If you are willing to take 310 in either term register in WTB.\nTo process the wait lists we will merge all the lists and as a seat\nbecomes available we will assign the seat to the person with the\nhighest priority who is willing to take the seat. Willingness to take\na seat is captured by the wait list the student registered in. For\nexample if seat becomes availaibe in section 201 then the highest\npriority student from wait lists WTB and WT2 will get the\nseat. When processing the wait lists students will be prioritized\nacross guidelines\n(see https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses/waitlists).\nNote: Depending upon how many students sign-up for this section either an additional tutorial section will be opened or the existing tutorials will be expanded slightly so as to have a sufficient number of seats for the students registered in the course.
