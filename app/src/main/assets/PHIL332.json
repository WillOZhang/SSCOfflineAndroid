{"reqs":"Instructor: David Friedell. Do animals have rights? Is it immoral to eat meat? Is nature valuable only to us? Does it have value that has nothing to do with us? Is the beauty of nature morally significant or a distraction? What moral obligations do we have to preserve the environment for future generations? How is it possible for use to owe something to people in the future if they dont exist yet?\nThese are some of the questions we will explore. This course will introduce students to Environmental Ethics and also the broader field of Ethics. We will begin by thinking about different moral theories: utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue theory. Then we will apply these theories to questions about our environment. Special consideration will be given to First Nations perspectives.\n","courseName":"Environmental Ethics","courseNumber":"332","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Moral problems arising in the context of human relationships to nature and to non-human living things, considered in terms of both general moral theory and policy formation.
