( And permission of the Department.)\nDIRECTED STUDIES\nCourse Description: Using a wide variety of modern and classic scholars, this class examines fashion from a\nsociological lens.

This course is also designed to allow students to engage with\nthe research process and to prepare for graduate students. Each student will choose a fashion\nrelated company to use as a case study for the topics we examine throughout the course, and as a\nbasis for a final research paper.
