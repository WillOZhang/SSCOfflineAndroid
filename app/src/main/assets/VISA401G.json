Humour, comedy, jokes, and laughter will become serious, offensive, and perhaps even painful. You will question why you laugh, why you dont, how and when, if it is okay to laugh, and if you endorse what you laugh at. The course covers various theories of humour such as tragedy, superiority, incongruity, irony and play. The course aims to dissect the ways in which art uses, and functions and performs much like humour. High seriousness and high humour are the same thing -Robert Smithson\nPlease note that online registration in 400 level VISA courses is restricted to our approved and declared VISA Majors and Honours students.
