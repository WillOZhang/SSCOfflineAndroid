{"reqs":"Topic: Popular Music Analysis and Collaborative Aesthetics. It has been the norm in academic writing on music -- particularly in history and appreciation texts -- for singular specialist or \"expert\" writers to select the composers/performers/works to be studied, often with little concern for the popularity of such material by audiences of its time. This seminar flips this practice on its head, looking to analyze in considerable detail ten of the best-selling albums of all time.\nUsing David Huron's psychological theory of anticipation as an organizing framework, we will as a class dedicate each seminar to a particular album, with all students providing weekly presentations on specific songs. The end goal is to begin to understand the relationship between commercial and critical success, the nature of the music selected, and how taking seriously truly \"popular\" music can expand our horizons as theorists and commentators on musical practice. Class will meet in Old Aud Ethno Seminar Room (206).\n","courseName":"Advanced Studies in Music History and Musicology - POP MUS AESTH","courseNumber":"532G","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"","sections":[{"section":"001"}]}
