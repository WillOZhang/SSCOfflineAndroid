What is the difference between knowing something and merely believing it? Do we have moral reasons to have certain beliefs? This course comprises an introduction to epistemology, the branch of philosophy concerning questions about knowledge and justified belief. It is a commonplace that there are more and less reasonable ways to believe, that we know many things, and that knowledge is in some sense an intellectual achievement. Epistemology concerns the attempt to determine whether these commonplace claims are true, in what they might consist, and how we might resolve the philosophical challenges to which they give rise. Topics include scepticism, theories of epistemic justification, the nature of knowledge, testimony and~\nand testimonial injustice, and the semantics of knows . No prior familiarity with philosophy will be assumed.\n","courseName":"Introduction to Epistemology","courseNumber":"240","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Topics in epistemology such as skepticism, truth, justification, a priori and a posteriori knowledge.
