{"reqs":"Pre-reqs: (Restricted to second- or higher-year standing.)\nInstructor: Thomas Bittner\nCourse Description and Aims:\nThis will be a survey course in the philosophy of law. One unit will be on jurisprudence, where we ask about the very nature of law. Is law merely a social, conventional practice? What is the relationship between law and morality? Is an immoral law not really a law at all? These debates now center around H. L. A. Harts masterpiece The Concept of Law. A second unit will cover some important opinions mainly from the Supreme Court of Canada. We will be discussing various Charter rights as well as some philosophically interesting issues concerning punishment.\nThe aim in this course is to familiarize you with some foundational questions about the nature of law, its purpose, and its practice in Canada. The course also seeks to hone your thinking and writing skills. I want you to think clearly, avoid confusion, pick apart bad arguments, and build good arguments.\n","courseName":"Philosophy of Law","courseNumber":"338","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Concepts of law, constitution and sovereignty; law and morality; natural law theories and legal positivism; obligation, responsibility, and punishment.","sections":[{"section":"002"},{"section":"001"}]}
