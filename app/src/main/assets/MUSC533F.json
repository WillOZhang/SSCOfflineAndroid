{"reqs":"Topic: Cognition of Musical Rhythm. With 403F in IBLC MUSC Seminar Room. Where does the power of musical rhythm to \"move\" us come from? Is 'feeling the beat' a uniquely human ability? This course is situated at the interface of music psychology and music theory, and it integrates concepts and methods from both fields. At the end of the semester, you will have gained critical understanding of the issues at stake in musical rhythm research and acquired a set of skills that will enable you to formulate research questions, conduct a literature review, and design an experimental pilot study.\nTopics surveyed include: developmental and cross-cultural issues, metric entrainment, microtiming, groove, and rhythmic complexity. (This course is open to non-music majors; music performance experience and/or ability to read music is not required, but will be helpful).\n","courseName":"Advanced Studies in Music Theory - COGN/MUSC RHYTHM","courseNumber":"533F","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Advanced seminar in music theory.
