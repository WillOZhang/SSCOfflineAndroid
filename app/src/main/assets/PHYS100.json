{"reqs":"Pre-reqs: Not open to students with credit for PHYS 12. (Principles of Mathematics 12 or Pre-calculus 12 is required; Physics 11 is required for first-year students, strongly recommended for others.)\nThe restricted seats in this section do not exclude 1st year science students. All first year students are allowed to register in this section. The section has a limited number of restricted seats for first year BA students. When these seats are full, first year BA students wanting to take PHYS 100 should register for the waitlist -- section 10W. All other seats are restricted to not allow FIRST YEAR BA students, but to allow OTHER FIRST YEAR STUDENTS to register.\nDo NOT contact the instructor as all registration is done centrally! Depending on the availability of the space, students will be placed in the course. Please contact Physics lab instructor Evert Koster evkoATphas.ubc.ca for registration inquiries or use the section change request form. http://www.phas.ubc.ca/~undergrad/section_change.shtml\nThe lecturer in this section of the course will utilize the Personal Response System (PRS, ie clickers) in the lecture room as a part of the instructional method for the course. Students should purchase a transponder (ie clicker) prior to attending the first lecture in the course. Please see the course website for further information.\nThe restricted seats in this section do not exclude 1st year science students. All first year students are allowed to register in this section.

Timetables MAY BE MODIFIED to allow conflict-free registration. Waitlisting does not guarantee placement in this course. If you are waitlisted, it is recommended that you access the SSC periodically to check your status. It is YOUR responsibility to check the SSC for registration changes.\nThis waitlist is for all term 1 laboratory sections.
