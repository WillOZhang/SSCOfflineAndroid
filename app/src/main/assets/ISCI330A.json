{"reqs":"Pre-reqs: (Third-year standing in the Faculty of Science)\nSymmetry touches all areas of science. In geometry, symmetry is the property by which the sides of a figure or object reflect each other across a line or surface. In biology, symmetry is the orderly repetition of parts of an animal or plant. Symmetry is important to chemistry because it explains observations in spectroscopy, quantum chemistry and crystallography. In physics symmetry is a concept of balance illustrated by such fundamental laws as the third of Newtons laws of motion. In this course we will explore all aspects of symmetry.\nThis course can be taken twice if different topics are taught in both offerings.\nStudents not in Integrated Sciences should register on the waitlist.\nPlease e-mail intsci@science.ubc.ca with registration questions about the course not the instructor.\nPlease e-mail intsci@science.ubc.ca with registration questions about the course not the instructor.\nStudents are moved into the lecture section from the waitlist by date of registration and year level as follows: IS students with approved contracts, IS students, BSc and BCS students, other.\n","courseName":"Topics in Integrated Sciences - TPCS INTEG SCIE","courseNumber":"330A","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Interactive examination of a theme common to all areas of science.
