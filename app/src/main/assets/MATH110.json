{"reqs":"Pre-reqs: (Pre-requisite: BC Principles of Mathematics 12 or Pre-calculus 12 (or equivalent), plus permission of the Mathematics Department; permission will normally be based on a low grade in BC Principles of Mathematics 12 or Pre-calculus 12 (or equivalent) and a low score in the optional UBC Mathematics Basic Skills Test if taken. See http://www.math.ubc.ca/Ugrad/m110.shtml for details. )\nPrerequisites for this course will be enforced. Register for MATH 110 if your grade in PCAL 12 is between 65-79%. If your grade is between 50-64%, you may try to qualify by writing the UBC Basic Skills Test (BST). MATH 110 is a 6-credit course that meets for two terms instead of one term. Students with 65%-79% in PCAL 12 may qualify for Math 100, 102, 104, 180, or 184 by attaining a satisfactory score in the optional BST, which will be given in Aug. and Sep. 2017. MATH 100, 102, and 104 also require a passing score in CALC 12.
