{"reqs":"Students who have received credit for CLST 331 (a six-credit course titled 'Ancient History' which was taught last in 2008) of may not receive credit also for either CLST 231 or CLST 232 (because the old CLST 331 Ancient History was simply divided into two three-credit courses, CLST 231 and 232, i.e., it had the same content as 231 and 232). This rule does not concern the new CLST 331 (first taught in\n2014) 'Greek Art and Architecture', which is a completely different course than the old CLST 331. If you are unsure about registration in any of these courses, please do not hesitate to contact the undergraduate advisor of CNERS, Dr. Lyn Rae (lyn.rae@ubc.ca).\nIf this course is blocked for registration, it is because it is full. Please register in the wait list section, and if and when a space becomes available, students will be automatically transferred \"in order\" from the wait list.\n","courseName":"Ancient Rome","courseNumber":"232","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"A survey of the ancient Roman world from the foundation of the city to the death of Constantine.","sections":[{"section":"001"}]}
