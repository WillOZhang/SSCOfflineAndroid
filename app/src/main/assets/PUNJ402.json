{"reqs":"Pre-reqs: PUNJ 300.\nIn this class we will read Waris Shah's mid-eighteenth century poem \"Heer\" in both Gurmukhi (the script utilized for Punjabi in India) and Shahmukhi (the Perso-Arabic script used for Urdu and Persian, which is utilized to write Punjabi in Pakistan). (Students must know one of these scripts to take the course, and will receive instruction in the script not known.) If you are concerned about your level of/background in Punjabi, please email the instructor. We will contextualize our reading of Heer by exploring secondary literature on Sufi (Islamic mystical) narrative traditions in Hindavi/Avadhi and Punjabi in the early modern period. period If this course is blocked please sign up for the waitlist section.
