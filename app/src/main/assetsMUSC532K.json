{"reqs":"This course explores the manifold ways in which, for four centuries, opera has intersected with, and addressed, social and political issues. Although the organization of the course is by and large chronological, the overall approach to the repertory is topical and will focus on the symbolic and material relationship between operatic culture and power, the socio-political realities that shaped opera's economic system, and the changing--and at times conflicting--ideological anxieties marking opera's reception. Themes will include opera and late-Renaissance social elites; opera's interaction with the ideology of absolutism; its becoming a topic of public debate before and after the French Revolution; its complicated (and by no means univocal) relationship with national ideologies and the iand~\nmage of the Other; its responsiveness to changing conceptions of subjectivity and social order at the turn of the 20th century; and its political and social relevance after World War II face to face the growing importance of other mass media.\nExtensive listening and reading assignments will be required, as well as three short essays and a final research paper. With 403K.\n","courseName":"Advanced Studies in Music History and Musicology - OPERA & POLITICS","courseNumber":"532K","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"","sections":[{"section":"001"}]}
