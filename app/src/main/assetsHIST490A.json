{"reqs":"(HIST 490 is intended for History majors, History honours students, and students majoring in the history and philosophy of science, but students from other departments may register if they obtain the instructor's permission)\nScience and Empire: This course will examine the historical relationship between science, technology, and empire from the 17th through the 20th century. We will discuss the ways that scientific knowledge was produced in the context of imperial expansion and exploration and how this knowledge was frequently mobilized to materially and discursively sustain empires. Students will investigate the construction of modern science in relation to exploration, national and imperial rivalries, global commerce and industry, and cultural perceptions of colonization and empire.\n","courseName":"Seminar for Majors in History - SEM FOR HIST MAJ","courseNumber":"490A","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Selected problems in the theory and practice of historical work.
