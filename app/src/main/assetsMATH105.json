{"reqs":"Pre-reqs: One of MATH 100, MATH 102, MATH 104, MATH 110, MATH 120, MATH 180, MATH 184.\nThe SIS will enforce automatically prerequisites for this course if you have not received credit for a prerequisite course in a previous term\nor are not registered in a prerequisite course. For example, if you have not received credit for MATH 100 or have not registered in it before\ntrying to register for the follow up course MATH 101, the system will block your registration for MATH 101.

Sometimes the system will show a pop up message that questions your\npre-requisite, however, ignore that if you know you have the prerequisite and you are successfullly registered. Adding a course to your Work List is not the same as registering for it, so, it is possible to add a course to your list without having the prerequisite but, when\nyou go to actually register, it will block you if no prerequisite is there.
