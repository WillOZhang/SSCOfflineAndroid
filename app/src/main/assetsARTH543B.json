{"reqs":"Photography in an Age of Surveillance and Violence: Susan Sontag has argued that images of violence pander to voyeurism, but do nothing to change the conditions that produce the suffering. Judith Butler has argued otherwise, making a case for the ability of photographs to alter social conditions. Among the questions the course will ask are: What strategies have been deployed by photographers, photo-based artists, filmmakers and video artists to intervene in a surveillant and globalized image-world? How should different spectator positions be understood in such an image-world?\n> Attention will be paid in the seminar to Canadian images and texts\n> where relevant.\n","courseName":"Studies in Canadian Art - CAN ART","courseNumber":"543B","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"","sections":[{"section":"001"}]}
