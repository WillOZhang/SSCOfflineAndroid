{"reqs":"TITLE: Mass and temperature effects on metabolic rates\nDESCRIPTION: Body mass and temperature are considered to be the most important drivers of variation in metabolic rates among organisms. This module shall serve as an introduction to how energy metabolism works and how it is regulated in animals, as well as an overview of concepts and data concerning how body mass and temperature generate intra- and interspecific variation in metabolic rates.\nInstructor: Raul Suarez Location: BioSci 1318\n","courseName":"Advanced Topics in Biology - ADV TOPICS BIOL","courseNumber":"548S","credits":"Credits: 1","description":"","sections":[{"section":"101"}]}
