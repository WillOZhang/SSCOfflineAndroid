{"reqs":"CPSC 103 is for any UBC student who wants to learn how to program in an introductory setting. You will learn sound programming skills that will allow you to solve problems in a discipline of your choice. You will learn the Python programming language but your main focus in this course will be on learning to design small, well-structured, readable programs rather than focusing on learning a particular programming language. You may take this course after taking CPSC 100, but may not take CPSC 100 after taking CPSC 103.
