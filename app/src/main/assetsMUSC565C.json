{"reqs":"KOREAN DRUMMING. For graduate students (undergraduates register in MUSC 165C 003). OPEN TO NON-MUSIC STUDENTS: How do I register for ensembles? For most ensembles an audition is required to secure your place. During the audition you play or sing a prepared piece for the conductor. Auditions for ensembles take place at the beginning of each academic year.
