The SIS will enforce automatically prerequisites for this course. Students will not be able to register themselves if they do not have the correct prerequisites. If you need to get your UBC file updated with qualifications such as Transfer Credits, take care of that by sending documentation to admissions.inquiry@ubc.ca. It is expected that all capacity in this course will be needed for students with a computational requirement that includes MATH 210 as an option. If MATH 210 is full, students with the math and statistics computational requirement should look to take CPSC 210. This includes graduating students.\nRegister for either MATH 210, Section L2A or L2B.\nRegister for one of MATH 210, Section L2A or L2B.\n","courseName":"Introduction to Mathematical Computing","courseNumber":"210","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Introduction to numerical computation, computer algebra, mathematical graphics.
