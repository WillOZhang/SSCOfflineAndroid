{"reqs":"Critical examination of the case of Buddhism in Asia in light of the emergence of the nation-state and theories of modernity. Buddhist groups have thought carefully about the functions of modern states and their place within them in terms of military service, violence, enforcement, social service, relief, and medical care. Buddhists have lived for, under, and through every imaginable political ideology: colonialism, nationalism, postcolonialism, fascism, communism, secular democracy, and capitalism. Some have participated in mainstream power politics and the rise of Asian nationalisms. Others have formed activist and interest groups, becoming involved in nonviolent protest. Yet others have defined themselves as strictly apolitical. The seminar will analyze specific configurations of Buddand~\nhism and the nation-state, and the idea that religion isor ought to beapolitical.\n","courseName":"Buddhism, Modernity, and the Nation-State in Asia","courseNumber":"562","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"","sections":[{"section":"016"}]}
