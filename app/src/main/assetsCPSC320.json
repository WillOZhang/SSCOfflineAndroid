{"reqs":"Pre-reqs: Either (a) CPSC 221 or (b) all of CPSC 260, EECE 320. ( In addition to above pre-requisites, at least 3 credits from COMM 291, BIOL 300, MATH or STAT at 200 level or above.)\nNote: Depending upon how many students sign-up for this section either an additional tutorial section will be opened or the existing tutorials will be expanded slightly. However, there is no guarantee that the resulting seats will fit your time table so make sure to take that into consideration when planning your time table.\n","courseName":"Intermediate Algorithm Design and Analysis","courseNumber":"320","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Systematic study of basic concepts and techniques in the design and analysis of algorithms, illustrated from various problem areas.
