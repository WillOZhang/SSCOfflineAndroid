{"reqs":"Pre-reqs: (PHIL/CLST 212 recommended.)\nPlato's dialogues embody a series of questions that have never lost their immediate vigour: how we should live, what there is, and how we can know. But it is the way that Plato posed those questions his rigour, his artful use of dialogue to justify both sides of a question, and the inspired vitality of his central arguments that renew the value of his original writing for each generation.
