{"reqs":"Pre-reqs: (One of BC Principles of Mathematics 12 or Pre-calculus 12 and one of (a) a grade of 80% or higher in BC Principles of Mathematics 12 or Pre-calculus 12, (b) a satisfactory score in the UBC Mathematics Basic Skills Test.)\nPrerequisites for this course will be strictly enforced. If you do not have a grade of 80% or better in Pre-Calclulus 12, please register in MATH 110. You may still be able to qualify for MATH 180 by satisfying prerequisite (c ), a satisfactory score in the UBC Mathematics Basic Skills Test. This test will be available to all students who are registered in MATH 110 in September 2017, but transferring to MATH 180 will be contingent on the availability of seats in this course even if a student receives a satisfactory score on the Basic Skills Test. See http://www.math.ubc.ca/Ugrad/bst.shtml. Section 101 of MATH 180 meets for 1 hour of lecture with everyone together then breaks out for 2, one hour recitation sessions in smaller groups of 40.
