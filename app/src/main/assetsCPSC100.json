{"reqs":"CPSC 100 is NOT a programming course, though there will be a small amount of programing in a visual language so that you can understand a bit of what makes computers tick. If you want to learn to program, we suggest that you take CPSC 103 or 110. However if you want a course that will change the way you think, give Computational Thinking a try.
