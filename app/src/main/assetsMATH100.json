{"reqs":"Pre-reqs: (High-school calculus and one of (a) a score of 80% or higher in BC Principles of Mathematics 12 or Pre-calculus 12, or (b) a satisfactory score in the UBC Mathematics Basic Skills Test.)\nPrerequisites for this course will be strictly enforced. If you have 80% or higher in Pre-Calculus 12 but do not\nhave the high school calculus prerequisite for this course, please register yourself in MATH 180. If you do not have a grade of 80% or better in Pre-Calclulus 12, please register in MATH 110. You may still be able to qualify for MATH 100 by satisfying prerequisite (c ), a satisfactory score in the UBC Mathematics Basic Skills Test. This test will be available to all students who are registered in MATH 110 in September, but transferring to MATH 100 will be contingent on the availability of seats in this course even if a student receives a satisfactory score on the Basic Skills Test.
