{"reqs":"Pre-reqs: One of PHYS 101, PHYS 107, PHYS 117, PHYS 157 and one of MATH 100, MATH 102, MATH 104, MATH 110, MATH 120, MATH 180, MATH 184.\nCo-reqs: One of MATH 101, MATH 103, MATH 105, MATH 121.\nPHYS 102 is split into lecture portion PHYS 118 and lab portion PHYS 119. All students taking PHYS 118 are strongly advised to also register for PHYS 119, the associated 1 credit lab course, since a lab component is required for most upper level lab courses in the sciences. However students taking PHYS 118 who have previously taken PHYS 107 cannot take PHYS 119 (credit excluded) and should take PHYS 109 lab instead. Students intending to pursue any of the Physics and Astronomy specializations definitely require the PHYS 109 or PHYS 119 lab.\nDo NOT contact course instructor for registration help. Please contact the Physics Undergraduate Program Coordinator ugcoordATphas.ubc.ca or use the section change request form. http://www.phas.ubc.ca/~undergrad/section_change.shtml\nPHYS 102 is split into lecture portion PHYS 118 and lab portion PHYS 119.
