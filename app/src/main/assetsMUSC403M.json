{"reqs":"This seminar offers a wide-ranging exploration of the notion of soundscape as it has been used in the disciplines of musicology, ethnomusicology, composition, and interdisciplinary sound studies more generally. Among the topics to be explored will be the origins of soundscape studies in the World Soundscape Project and other related movements; the perception of sound, space, and acoustic phenomena; the study of historical soundscapes; the role of soundscape in selected studies of world traditions; and developments in soundscape composition.\nThe seminar will involve in-depth readings and discussions in each of these areas, regular student presentations, guest lectures, and a final research/creative project to be developed in consultation with the instructor. The course is open to third- and fourth-year undergraduate students (BMUS, GMUS, BA) and graduate students (PHD, MA, MMUS) both within and outside the School of Music.
