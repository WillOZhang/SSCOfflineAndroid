{"reqs":"TITLE: Ecosystem Ecology\nDESCRIPTION:\nFrom the classic paper Tansley 1935 to a debate about whether novel ecosystems are a real thing, this course covers fundamental concepts in ecosystem ecology as they have shaped ecological thinking over the last century. Course goals are a) to understand the fundamental concepts in ecosystem ecology, their historical development and contemporary application, b) to describe ecological systems in terms of flows of energy, mass, and information, and c) to critically assess evidence-based arguments in ecosystem ecology. We will read classic papers from terrestrial, aquatic and marine systems, and major topics include succession, nutrient cycling and stability.\nLocation: BioDiv 224\n","courseName":"Advanced Topics in Biology - ADV TOPICS BIOL","courseNumber":"548J","credits":"Credits: 1","description":"","sections":[{"section":"201"}]}
