From the Buddhist tradition, we will examine the philosophical thought of the Buddha, Theravda Buddhist analyses of the person, and Mahayana Buddhist philosophy (the Madhyamaka or Middle Way school as presented by the philosophers Ngrjuna and Zntideva, and the Yogcra or Yoga Practice school as presented by the philosopher Vasubandhu).
