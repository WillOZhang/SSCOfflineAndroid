{"reqs":"Ling 448: Information about Directed Studies Courses\nYou cannot use the on-line system to register for Ling 448 (Directed\nStudies). You need to consult the Linguistics Department\nUndergraduate Advisor and work with a professor to develop a course\nproposal. Once your proposal is approved, the Undergraduate Advisor\nwill register you for the course.\nDirected Studies courses are intended for the case where a student\nwants to work on a particular topic or project that is not covered in\nany existing course. If you have such a project in mind, the first\nstep is to talk to relevant professors, and persuade a professor that\nthis would be an interesting thing to do, and that you have the\nappropriate background to do it.\nOnce you have located a professor who wants to supervise your Directed\nStudy, you work with the professor to draft a short course\ndescription, specifying readings, course requirements, grading\ncriteria, and a tentative schedule for assignments and meetings with\nthe supervisor. This description should be short, usually less than a\npage, but it will require a fair amount of research on your part and\nseveral drafts. When you and the professor agree on a description,\nyou both sign it, and bring it to the Undergraduate Advisor, who\nneeds to approve the proposal, acting as the Department Head's\nrepresentative.\nSince the teacher is not paid for supervising a Directed Studies\ncourse, it is usually only appropriate to ask people who are part of\nthe regular faculty.\nDirected Studies (Ling 448) does not have any specified prerequisites,\nbut you are unlikely to come up with a suitable project unless you\nhave already done the core courses in the relevant general area.\nFor more information, contact:\nHenry Davis\nUndergraduate Advisor\nDepartment of Linguistics, University of British Columbia\noffice: 2613 West Mall, Vancouver, British Columbia\nV6T1Z4, Canada\ntel: 604-822-8948 messages 604-822-0415\nfax: 604-822-9687\ne-mail: henry.davis@ubc.ca\nLing 448: Information about Directed Studies Courses\nYou cannot use the on-line system to register for Ling 448 (Directed\nStudies).
