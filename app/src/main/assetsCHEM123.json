You will be moved into active registration IF space becomes available. Timetables MAY BE MODIFIED to allow conflict-free registration. Waitlisting does not guarantee placement in this course. If you are waitlisted, it is recommended that you access the SSC periodically to check your status. It is YOUR responsibility to check the SSC for registration changes.\nStudents who are waitlisting for this course and who complete the prerequisite course will be placed in lecture and laboratory sections of the course in late December once the results of the prerequisite course are available. All students who pass the prerequisite course will normally be placed in active registration (subject to space availability).\n","courseName":"Thermodynamics, Kinetics and Organic Chemistry","courseNumber":"123","credits":"Credits: 4","description":"Fundamentals of chemical reactivity: thermodynamics; kinetics; organic chemistry, including stereochemistry; applications relevant to modern society.","sections":[{"section":"L03"},{"section":"L02"},{"section":"L05"},{"section":"210"},{"section":"L07"},{"section":"211"},{"section":"222"},{"section":"266"},{"section":"299"},{"section":"201"},{"section":"L06"},{"section":"202"},{"section":"L09"},{"section":"L08"},{"section":"203"}]}
