{"reqs":"In Theatre 500 we will investigate a range of critical theatre studies methodologies. The course aims to develop research, writing, editing and conceptual skills associated with the profession. As a practical course, you will be asked to do a lot of writing and re-writing as well as critical editing of each other's work. Students will be responsible for two seminar presentations and one final essay. As with all graduate courses, critical engagement with course materials and full attendance is required, particularly as classes meet only once a week.\n","courseName":"Bibliography and Research Methods","courseNumber":"500","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"","sections":[{"section":"001"}]}
