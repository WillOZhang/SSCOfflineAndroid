{"reqs":"(HIST 490 is intended for History majors, History honours students, and students majoring in the history and philosophy of science, but students from other departments may register if they obtain the instructor's permission.)\nHistory Lab: The History of News This course enables students to develop and implement a digital project on the history of news. Digital tools are particularly promising for studying the history of news, a subject with so many sources that we can only start to access, catalogue, and analyze many of them with digitization and computer technology. In this project, students will combine digital techniques with the history of news. They will examine why newspapers printed particular stories and not others. Students can acquire skills in digital databases and analysis, mapping techniques, and oral presentation.\n","courseName":"Seminar for Majors in History - SEM FOR HIST MAJ","courseNumber":"490T","credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Selected problems in the theory and practice of historical work.
