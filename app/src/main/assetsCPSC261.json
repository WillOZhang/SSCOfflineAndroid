Once we know how many STT and restricted seats are unused, we will admit students from the wait list to the course. Note that a sufficient number of lab seats will be opened, although perhaps not immediately, to accommodate all the students registered in the course. However, there is no guarantee that the open lab seats will fit a student's time table so make sure to take that into consideration when planning your course schedule.\nFor students who don't have access to this section by either restricted seats or STT seats please register on the wait list.
